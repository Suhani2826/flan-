Step:1
Special Equipment: 9-in/23-cm x 5-in/12.5-cm loaf pan; 9-in/23-cm x 13 in/33-cm x 2-in/5-cm pan; spatula; pastry brush; fine mesh strainer; aluminum foil; thermometer; wire baking rack; paring knife
Step:2
Position one oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325ºF/165ºC/gas 3. Place a 9-in/23-cm x 5-in/12.5-cm loaf pan in the oven to heat. (A preheated loaf pan helps spread the caramel).
Step:3
Make the caramel: In a small saucepan add the sugar and ¼ cup of water. Set the pan on a stove set to medium-low heat and cook, stirring gently with a spatula until the sugar crystals dissolve. Once the sugar crystals have dissolved, stop stirring. Brush the sides of the pan using a pastry brush dipped in water to prevent crystallization. Bring to a boil, then continue to cook until the caramel is a deep amber color, another 10-12 minutes. Swirl the pan as needed to make sure the caramel is cooked evenly.
